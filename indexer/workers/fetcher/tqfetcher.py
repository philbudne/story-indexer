"Threaded Queue Fetcher" using RabbitMQ

NOTE! As of 2023 with CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means
that threads don't give greater concurrency than async/coroutines
(only one thread/task runs at a time), BUT PEP703 describes work in
progress to eliminate the GIL, over time, enabling the code to run on
multiple cores.

When a Story can't be fetched because of connect rate or concurrency
limits, the Story is queued to a "fast delay" queue to avoid book keeping
complexity (and having an API that allows not ACKing a message immediately).

In theory we have thirty minutes to ACK a message
before RabbitMQ has a fit (closes connection), so
holding on to Stories that can't be processed
immediately is POSSIBLE, *BUT* the current API acks
the message on return from process_message.

To delay ACK would need:
1. A way to disable automatic ACK (ie; return False)
2. Passing the delivery tag (or whole InputMessage - bleh) to process_story
3. An "ack" method on the StorySender object.

Handling retries (on connection errors) would either require
re-pickling the Story, or the InputMessage
